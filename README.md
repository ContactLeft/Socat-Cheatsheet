# Socat-Cheatsheet

I`ve used netcat for years, only recently decided to get my head around socat, this is just my ramblings / notes / part of how i learn new things.

Was originally on my Pastebin, sorry for formatting if its slightly askew. 

Added a few notes on Socat, and how to connect using various methods.

Precomiled Binaries from: https://github.com/ernw/static-toolbox for uploading to hosts that dont have socat installed (most!)

Main Project Page : http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/

TryHackme Room where tested and snippets taken on stabilisation: https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells
